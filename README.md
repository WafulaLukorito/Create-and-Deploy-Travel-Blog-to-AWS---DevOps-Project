# Create and Deploy Travel Blog to AWS - DevOps Project

In this project, I created a static travel blog and deployed it to AWS using `S3`, `CloudFront`, and `IAM`.

## Project Overview
 - Created a static travel blog using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. 
    - I used `Bootstrap` to help with the styling.
    - I used `jQuery` to help with the functionality.
- Deployed the website to a public `S3 bucket` and configured it to serve static content.
- Secured the deployment using `IAM policies`.
- Used `CloudFront` as a content delivery network (CDN) to speed up distribution of the website to users around the world.
